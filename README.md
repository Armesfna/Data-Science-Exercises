I created notes by doing exercises with Python visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, and I wanted to share these notes to contribute to those who want to progress in visualization.

I hope these notes will help you improve your visualization skills and be useful for other learners like you. I look forward to your comments and feedback!
